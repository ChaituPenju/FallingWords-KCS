## Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
* Used MVVM pattern (repository and live data) to retrieve json words, and storing, retrieval of player's previous scores using room database.
* Used kotlin collection's 'random()' function to select random question and answers


## Decisions made because of Restricted TIME
* had to skip implementation of dependency injection
* had to skip implementation of testing due to less time

## Improvements or Additions if I had time
* would have implemented dependency injection
* would have implemented testing
* would have added validations and proper flow
